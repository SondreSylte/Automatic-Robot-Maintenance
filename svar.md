# Answer File - Mandatory 1
# Description of each Implementation
Briefly describe your implementation in the different strategies. What was your plan and how did you execute it? If there were any problems and/or issues failed implementations please add a description.

# Runtime Analysis
For each method of the different strategies give a runtime analysis in Big-O notation and a description of why it has this runtime.

**If you have implemented new methods not listed you must add these as well.**
## Task 1 - RandomStrategy
