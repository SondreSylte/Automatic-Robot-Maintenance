# Runtime Analysis
For each method of the different strategies give a runtime analysis in Big-O notation and a description of why it has this runtime.

**If you have implemented new methods not listed you must add these as well.**
## RandomStrategy
### IStrategy
* ``registerRobots(List<Robot> robots)``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>
* ``registerNewJob(Job job)``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>
* ``registerJobAsFulfilled(Job job)``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>

### AbstractStrategy (if you use it)
* ``doJobs()``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>
* ``selectJob()``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>
* ``removeJob(Job job)``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>
* ``assignRobots(List<Robot> selected, Job job)``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>
* ``getAvailableRobots()``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>

### RandomStrategy
* ``selectRobots(Job job, List<Robot> available)``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>

## ClosestStrategy
### IStrategy
* ``registerRobots(List<Robot> robots)``: O(?)

    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>
* ``registerJobAsFulfilled(Job job)``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>

### AbstractStrategy (if you use it)
* ``doJobs()``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>

    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>
* ``getAvailableRobots()``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>

### ClosestStrategy
* ``selectRobots(Job job, List<Robot> available)``: O(?)
    * <Insert description of why the method has the given runtime>

## BetterStrategy
