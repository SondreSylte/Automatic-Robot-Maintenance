# Automatic Robot Maintenance
## Semester assignment 1

### Scenario
You are hired as a consultent at Automatic Robot Maintenance (ARM). They have many years of experience  in robot technology and cybernetics. Recently ARM has landed a new contract for maintaining a large field of solar panels. Close to the solar panels there is a garbage disposal plant and some trash has a tendency to cover and dirty the solar panels, so that they do not produce any electricity. The company who owns the solar panels has constructed a system to detect if solar panels are recieving less light so that they can check for trash covering them. However, they have become tired of manually cleaning the solar panels and has therefore hired ARM to automate this task. The robots have been programmed to move on the solar panel field and to clean the solar panels, but currently it is taking too long to move the robots to where they need to be. 

ARM is in need of an algorithm to choose the correct robots to clean which solar panels and to position the robots so that they can execute a cleaning job as soon as the system detects one. ARM gets payed extra for each solar panel they clean, but lose money for each minute a solar panel is not operational due to being dirty.

### Online algorithm
This is what we call an online algorithm. You have to make choices based on the information you have in the moment and when future tasks arise you soon discover that your original choices where not optimal.

### Code 
You are given a framework which includes:
 * Location.java - describes a location using double values ``x`` and ``y``
 * Job.java - describes a job generated by the alert system which monitors if the solar panels are generating electricity
